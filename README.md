>[!IMPORTANT]
>These scripts are **NOT intended to harm or exploit the game [Ikariam](https://lobby.ikariam.gameforge.com/en_GB/)** in any way. They do not perform any unauthorized actions, hack the game, or bypass game mechanics.
>Instead, these are **manual helper tools** created to enhance communication and collaboration among players, aligning with fair-play principles.
>
>**These scripts do not provide premium features or advantages** to non-premium users. All users, regardless of their account status, can manually gather the same information, but it requires more time and effort. These scripts simply automate the process, allowing players to perform the same actions more quickly and efficiently.
